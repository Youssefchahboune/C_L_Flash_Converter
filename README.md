# Currency and Length Converter

## Projectâ€™s Title

     Flash Converter

## Project Description

   ### What my application does : 
   
   My application is a currency and length converter, which means it can convert a value from one currency to another or a measurement from one unit to      another. To be more specific, the currency converter can convert between four currencies: CAD, USD, YEN, and EURO. As well as the length converter        which can also convert between four units of length: KM, M, MM, and CM.

   ### How it was built and what technologies I used :
   
   My application's logic was implemented in Java, and the GUI was developed in JavaFX, a java library that can be used to create both desktop and Rich      Internet Applications.

   ### Some challenges that I faced and features I hope to implement in the future :
   
   Some of the challenges that I faced while building this project were designing the JavaFX layout for my GUI due to the use of many Hboxes and Vboxes      in one another, designing a colour palette for my application, debugging my code while performing unit tests, and finally coming up with a regex          expression that takes whole numbers and decimal numbers.

   In the future, I'd like to add more functionalities to my project, such as an API that fetches the currencies directly rather than hard coding them,      as well as more than four currencies and unit lengths, and lastly more than two converters.
